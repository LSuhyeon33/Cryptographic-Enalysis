=========================================
WC20R - Weak Cipher (encryption/decryption)

 - version 5:
         Weak Cipher - 조금 취약한 Sbox 사용 (최대차분확률=0.52)
 - version 4:
         Bad Cipher - 취약한 Sbox 사용  (최대차분확률=1)
 - version 3:
            R: Reduced Round (부분 라운드 암호화 기능을 추가)
            Whitening(화이트닝) 추가 - 암호문 생성 직전에 라운드키 XOR 추가
 - version 2: 
      동일한 라운드함수만 사용함
      키 스케줄 없음
      복호화 추가
